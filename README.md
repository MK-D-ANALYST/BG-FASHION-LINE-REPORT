Sum of Selling Area by Competitive Territory (Top Left Chart):

This bar chart shows the total selling area divided by whether or not the territory is competitive.
The chart indicates that most of the selling area belongs to non-competitive territories ("No"), with a much smaller portion belonging to competitive territories ("Yes").
The non-competitive areas seem to account for more than 2 million units of selling area, while competitive areas account for less than 1 million units.
Sum of Annual Sales by Chain (Top Right Chart):

This bar chart shows the total annual sales for two chains: Fashions Direct and Lindseys.
Fashions Direct significantly outperforms Lindseys, with sales nearing 80 million, while Lindseys sales are less than 40 million.
Sales and Selling Area Scatter Plot (Bottom Left Chart):

This scatter plot compares sales (on the x-axis) with selling area (on the y-axis).
You can see that higher sales generally correspond to larger selling areas, but there is variation. Some locations have lower sales despite large selling areas.
The data is clustered in different regions, suggesting that some selling areas generate higher sales than others.
Table (Bottom Right):

The table provides detailed data for each location, including the name of the location, ID, chain, territory, whether it's in a competitive territory, the sales amount, and the selling area.
You can see which specific locations belong to Fashions Direct or Lindseys and whether they fall under a competitive territory or not. The selling area and sales are also displayed to provide context.
In summary, Fashions Direct is outperforming Lindseys both in terms of total sales and selling area. Non-competitive territories dominate in terms of selling area, and larger selling areas typically generate higher sales, though this is not always the case.
